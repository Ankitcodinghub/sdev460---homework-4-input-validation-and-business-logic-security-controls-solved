<strong>Overview: </strong>

This homework will demonstrate your knowledge of testing security controls aligned with Input validation and business logic. You will also use the recommended OWASP testing guide reporting format to report your test findings.

<strong>Assignment: Total 100 points </strong>

Using the readings from weeks 7 and 8 as a baseline provide the following test and analysis descriptions or discussion:

<ol>
<li>Testing for Reflected Cross site scripting (OTG-INPVAL-001)
<ul>
<li>The OWASP site list multiple approaches and examples for blackbox testing reflected XSS vulnerabilities. In your own words, describe Reflected Cross Site scripting. Then, List and describe <strong>4</strong> different examples that could be used for testing. Be sure to conduct additional research for each example to provide your own <strong>unique</strong> test example. This most likely means you will need to conduct some research on Javascript to make sure your syntax is correct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing for Stored Cross site scripting (OTG-INPVAL-002)
<ul>
<li>The OWASP site list multiple approaches and examples for blackbox testing Stored XSS vulnerabilities. In your own words, describe Stored Cross Site scripting. Then, List and describe 2 different examples that could be used for testing. Be sure to conduct additional research for each example to provide your own <strong>unique</strong> test example. This most likely means you will need to conduct some research on Javascript to make sure your syntax is correct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing for SQL Injection (OTG-INPVAL-005)
<ul>
<li>SQL Injection remains a problem in applications yet could easily fixed. The following SQL statement is in an HTML form as code with the $ variables directly input from the user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

SELECT * FROM Students WHERE EMPLID=‚Äô$EMPLID‚Äô AND EMAIL=‚Äô$email‚Äô

Would a form or application that includes this code be susceptible to SQL Injection? Why?

What specific tests would you perform to determine if the applications was vulnerable?

How would you fix this problem? Be specific be providing the exact code in a Language of your choice. (e.g. Java, PHP, Python ‚Ä¶)

&nbsp;

<ol start="4">
<li>Test business logic data validation (OTG-BUSLOGIC-001)
<ul>
<li>While reviewing some Java code, an analysis provided the following code snippets that contain logic errors. For each example, describe the issue and provide code that would fix the logical error:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
int x; x = x + 1;

System.out.println(‚ÄúX = ‚Äù + x);

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
for (i=1; i&lt;=5; i++) ; {

System.out.println(‚ÄúNumber is ‚Äù + i); }

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
if ( z &gt; d) ;&nbsp; {

System.out.println(‚ÄúZ is bigger‚Äù); }

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
String m1=‚Äùone‚Äù; String m2=‚Äùtwo‚Äù; if(m1 == m2) {

System.out.println(‚ÄúM1 is equal to M2‚Äù); }

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:</li>
</ol>
A = (b1+b2)/2 * h

The following Java code is the implementation. Fix the logical error

double area; double base1 = 2.3; double base2 = 4.8; double height = 12.5; area = base1 + base2/2.0 * height;

&nbsp;

Demonstrate your fixed code work as anticipated with a couple different test cases.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<ol start="5">
<li>Test integrity checks (OTG-BUSLOGIC-003)</li>
</ol>
ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct some additional research on Business Logic errors related to OTG-BUSLOGIC-003. In your own words describe and provide 2 unique examples of integrity checks. For your examples, provide specific testing methods for each case.

<ol start="6">
<li>Test defenses against Circumvention of Work Flows (OTG-BUSLOGIC-006)</li>
</ol>
ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct some additional research on Business Logic errors related to OTG-BUSLOGIC-006. In your own words describe and provide 2 unique examples of circumvention of work flow. For your examples, provide specific testing methods for each case.

You should document the results for the tests and your comments, and recommendations for improved security for each security control tested in a word or PDF document. Discuss any issues found and possible mitigations.

<strong>Deliverables: </strong>

You should submit your document by the due date. Your document should be well-organized, include all references used and contain minimal spelling and grammar errors.
